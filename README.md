# Learning Rust with Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. I'm using these programming puzzles as a way to learn and improve my Rust programming skills.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released with two parts to solve.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- Learning Rust programming language
- Improving problem-solving skills
- Understanding Rust's unique features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Practicing writing clean and idiomatic Rust code

## Structure

Each day's solution will be organized in its own directory, making it easy to navigate through different challenges.

## Running the Solutions

To run any solution:

1. Navigate to the specific day's directory:

```bash
cd dayXX    # Where XX is the day number (01-25)
```

2. Run the solution using cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Learning Progress

This repository serves as a documentation of my Rust learning journey. Each solution might be refined over time as I learn better ways to write Rust code.

## Disclaimer

These are personal solutions created for learning purposes. They might not be the most optimal solutions, but they represent my learning progress with Rust.
